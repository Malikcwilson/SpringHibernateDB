# SpringHibernateDB
Student Database App Project (CRUD)

I created a student database using Spring, Hibernate, JSP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL. The users can add a new student, delete a student, or update a studentâ€™s information.

Once you unzip the project, open MySQL workbench and select Open SQL script and select both files under Student-Tracker DB. Once you open both scripts, open eclipse. In eclipse, import the student-tracker project and select run on server. Make sure you have Tomcat setup in eclipse.
